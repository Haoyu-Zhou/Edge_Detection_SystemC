# Edge_Detection_SystemC
Using SystemC to simulate edge detection algorithm

In this project, I tried to use systemC to reconstruct the code of canny edge detection algorithm.

Canny edge is one of the most popular image edge detection algorith, for more detail, please read Canny, J., A Computational Approach To Edge Detection, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 8(6):679â€“698, 1986. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4767851

In order to verify canny edge whether can be applied on embedded device like Raspberry Pi, I did the simulation by SystemC. To know how canny edge works, how to acclerate algorithm by pipeline and palleling, how to reconstruct code to hierarchical structure, please find detail from report.pdf.
